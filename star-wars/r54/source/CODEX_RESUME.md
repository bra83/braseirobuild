# Codex resume

- Captured: 2026-10-16 (America/Sao_Paulo)
- Repository: `bra83/braseirobuild`
- Branch: `codex/star-wars-hibrido-integral-20261016`
- Base HEAD: `98b6a391401818e74eaa53c752cc98dc9082fea9`
- Last verified local and remote checkpoint before current Old Lylek p.16 map integration: `e99ef6cdf555f06413e601f791258c61aa6ab925` (Old Lylek roster/party effects WIP)
- Source working copy: `work/star-wars/project`; sparse Git checkout: `work/star-wars/repo-sparse/star-wars/r54/source`
- P244 SHA-256: `6f3dca72ea55080b4ce7e6befeb5d4d84e51f63453ead6a5719495178a40d264`
- WIP5 MERGED SHA-256: `7615fc8d156f8909a7a31b0878d6e08715cd71867325c5ad6c97ac5dd830409e`
- SWE02 remains `IMPLEMENTADO_NAO_CERTIFICADO`; T’rex carryover is integrated from SWE02 p.15 + Beginner Game Adventure Book p.24 with persisted three-choice history, verified profile, replacement hunter slot, and 10 wounds only for unconfirmed death. Solo/unknown party-size with living T’rex remains pending under the source-required Gand/count constraint. Old Lylek p.15–18 now has scoped persisted roster/effects, ruse, combat branches, loot, arrival and an interactive named-zone schematic. The map explicitly has no scale, distances, range bands, cover geometry or LOS. Focused suite 17/17; sparse affected sweep 187/187; offline bundle 133 modules PASS. Page and Act 1 remain uncertified; runtime GM choices and remaining adventure details are listed in `evidence/SWE02_OLD_LYLEK_P15_18_BLOCK/RESULTS.md`.
- Official source audits are pushed for all five authorized adventures: SWE02, SWEP01, SWE05, SWE09, SWE13. All five remain uncertified.
- AoR 360 proof rows: 0 certified, 360 pending. Twenty Gunner slots and two Sharpshooter Brace positions have source evidence. Brace helper/source focused suite passes 18/18; action/controller/UI consumption and save/reopen are unproven.
- Drive inventory: 527 records/44 folders; 500 remain unreviewed. Metadata triage covers 57 PDFs in `audits/INVENTORY_PDF_METADATA_TRIAGE.md`; 0 PDF bytes examined. The 19-entry handoff rules-corpus matrix has 3 `PRESENT`, 3 `TITLE_ONLY`, 4 `UNRESOLVED`, 9 `ABSENT`; the final selected-supplement boundary remains unconfirmed. See `audits/RULES_CORPUS_RECONCILIATION.md`.
- Prior full per-file regression: 378 files (372 regular + 6 stress), 3,399 tests, 3,397 pass, 0 fail, 2 explained JDK-dependent skips. This run predates T’rex integration and is stale for the current WIP. Logs: `evidence/fresh-regression-20261016-old-lylek-rerun/`.
- No APK/Gradle/device gate, P245, Drive backup/readback, or PR has been run/created. No non-Star-Wars VTT files touched.

## Exact next actions

1. Commit and push the reviewed Old Lylek map/combat implementation and evidence from `work/star-wars/repo-sparse/star-wars/r54/source`; verify with `git ls-remote`.
2. Run the complete regression of all 372 regular test files individually plus six stress suites; preserve exact logs and resolve any failures before proceeding.
3. Continue SWE02 Act 1 pp.2–24 from `audits/SWE02_ACT1_DEEP_AUDIT.md`; all page/adventure statuses remain uncertified until their exact source→executor→UI→save/reopen→test gates close.
4. Continue complete SWE02 coverage through Acts 1–3, then SWEP01, SWE05, SWE09, SWE13, rules families and all 360 AoR positions; keep claims uncertified until their full semantic gates pass.
5. Do not create P245 or run Android release gates before all five adventure and rules gates pass.
